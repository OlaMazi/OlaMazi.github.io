UPDATE
====
So we've decided, taking a few things into consideration - weather and arrivals, etc - that we will have the ceremony start at 4pm at the Aloni in Douliana. 

The location is searchable in GoogleMaps, but here's a map just in case.

We'll have a more detailed agenda for you in the coming days when we have some finer details ironed out. Until then, we look forward to see you all.
