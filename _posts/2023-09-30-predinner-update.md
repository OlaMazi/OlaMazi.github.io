UPDATE
====
Hi all. We're moving the pre-dinner meal to the 5th to accommodate our relies coming in from Scotland - it just wouldn't be fun without them. 

*Also* - and this is important to remember - the 'pre-dinner' may be just a late lunch, we'd like to play it by ear. No one is asked to come, but if you wanted to have a bite to eat, then we'd say an hour or two somewhere nearby, no obligations, no stress. Some of you have already said you wouldn't be able to make it to a pre-dinner, no worries at all. Enjoy your time!
