Gifts
=======

We tried 6 different registry sites, all with their nice website designs and percentage cuts, and in the end we realised we were overthinking things. 
Well....what can we say. We can't - so many of you travelled very far, complicating your lives and spending a lot to do so. So we paraphrase (i.e. blatantly poach from Dan's cousin, with permission): 

{: .box-note}
**Note:** We know that traditionally you would all like to buy a gift in recognition of our joyous day, however as we have already used up the majority of your creative bandwidth just getting here we would not object to cash gifts.

That said, exactly that. We have more things already than we can move in a weekend, which is new to both of us (and I've got a sizable headstart on Sarah). Mostly we are looking at services, not products -- saving up for the big honeymoon trip (Asia via Asia), fixing the cars inside and out, fixing the pets (mostly inside), and just saving up a warchest for the next major turning point -- will they be short and slender, or tall and round? 


If you would like to send money, the easiest way is bank transfer to Dan's Revolut account:

Enough jokes. Sincerely, thank you, we love you all.
