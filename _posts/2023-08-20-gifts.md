Gifts
=======

We tried a bunch of different registry sites, all with their nice website designs and percentage cuts, and in the end we realised we were overthinking things ...and most of them had horror stories. 

Well....what can we say. We can't. So we paraphrase (i.e. blatantly poach from Dan's cousin, with permission): 

{: .box-note}
We know that traditionally many of you would like to buy a gift in recognition of our joyous day, however as we have already used up the majority of your creative bandwidth just getting here we would not object to cash gifts.

That said, exactly that. We have more things already than we can move in a weekend, which is new to both of us (and Dan has a sizable headstart on Sarah). Mostly, we are looking at "services", not "things" -- saving up for the **big** honeymoon trip (we're looking at you Japan and China), fixing (rebuilding) the cars inside and out, fixing the pets (mostly inside), and just saving up a warchest for the next major turning point -- will they be short and slender, or tall and round? 


If that's something you're interested in, the easiest way is bank transfer to Dan's Revolut account:

- the Greek way would be to pin it on Sarah at the dinner (we hear).

Enough jokes. Sincerely, thank you, we love you all.
