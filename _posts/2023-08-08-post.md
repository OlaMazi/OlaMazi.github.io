## Welcome to our little website

So, essentially, Dan never took web design classes and only had rudimentary skills at site design and hosting, etc etc etc. That's life...let's move on.

We'll be updating any news here -- so bookmark this, not the registry site (or both...or don't). 

**Why this website and not just the registry?**
Well, this site we can take down once it's all done and dusted, whereas only George Carlin knows what happens to our data on the registry site. Also, ....because.

Stay Tuned!
