Hungry?
=

We think you will be. In order to make sure we have enough for you to eat, it would be really useful to know what you will be eating/drinking (and thereby, coming) so we can order enough - this is mostly an alcohol thing. We're happy to have you with us, but let us know please how many and what.

We have some of you bringing newer versions of yourselves. We have a playground for the littler ones (or anyone who's not given up on fun), and it's a gated venue for the roamy ones. 

You can use this survey Dan set up to get a sense of this (most of you received this already, but some people didn't get the email we sent):
