UPDATE -- AGAIN
====

So, we've had to push back the late lunch/mezzas to *8ish*. There's not a whole lot of space, but we'll make do - we think you all knows us pretty well :) 

It's just a little square in the middle of the village. There's also a restaurant next to it. If we don't see you there, we'll see you tomorrow!

(we're a little excited...just a little)
