So, we're fine, everything's fine...everything is....do you all have accommodation and something to wear?

Accommodations
-----
We have to let go of one of the villa's we reserved. We have filled the other, so if you still need accommodation, please let us know if we can help somehow. 

Dinner
-----
Depending on the final RSVPs, we will have a dinner the night of the 4th so we can all see eachother and establish cliques -- yes, yes, we know "everyone is going to get along" -- we also know all of you, and some of you will need to know who's to watch out for at the cocktail section (Karen). 

Decorations
-----

Some of you have asked if you can chip in with the decorations - really nice of you, thanks again. If anyone else wants to also chip in - and we really advise you take your time to explore Crete instead, that will be taking part starting the 3rd/4th. Just send us an email or something.
